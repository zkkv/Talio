### Chair performance
>Mark: **Good**

Feedback: There is still room to grow here. I like the  synergy of the team and that everyone seems to get along well. But the chairman also has to be a little more organise and make sure that the meeting is productive and that everyone is prepared for it and also prepared to talk.
#### Tops:
- Managed time well.
- Incorporated feedback from last week.
- Was the one that guided the conversation.
#### Tips:
- People took initiative during the meeting to answer each other and to speak their mind, however sometimes the chairman should be the one managing people's time.
