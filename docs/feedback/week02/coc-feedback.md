# Code of conduct Feedback
### Submission

>Mark: **Pass**

Feedback: 
- Very good Markdown formatting!
- You did not have to include the questions.

### General
>Mark: **Good**

Feedback: Your formatting looks very good, and you took the time to work on this so that it suits my previous feedback, good job! However, some sections can still be improved as you grow as a team.

### Assignment Description

>Mark: **Good**

Feedback: I like that you gathered some ideas from the study guide, some from what the coding assignment entails and some personal philosophies. I want to see this as a paragraph and not necessarily you're answering the question with a list.
#### Tops:
- Has most of the relevant information.
#### Tips:
- I don't think a list format suits this section.

### Products

>Mark: **Good**

Feedback: As a product description, I would say you nailed most of it, but you can still add some quality control to the product that you are creating.
#### Tops:
- Product description is very good and clear.
- Talks about means of uploading the product.
#### Tips:
- Should have something about documentation, code quality, testing.

### Planning

>Mark: **Good**

Feedback: You seem organised in relation too uploading assignments, however I would like you to improve this section in terms of planning in GitLab, Sprints, Epics etc.
#### Tops:
- Good information, I like that you have responsible persons listed.
#### Tips:
- No information regarding iteration plans, SCRUM etc.

### Communication

>Mark: **Good**

Feedback:
#### Tops:
- Stated the channels.
#### Tips:
- But how and when do you communicate with the TA?

### Commitment

>Mark: **Good**

Feedback: You can also mention *how* your roles act. How does the secretary take notes? What should the agenda have?
#### Tops:
- Mentions the minimum that each member has to contribute.
#### Tips:
- Does not mention anything related to how you would like the chairman and note taker to perform


### Division of Tasks and Roles
  
>Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: 
#### Tops:
- A good way of selecting the chairman and minute taker.
#### Tips:
- This can also be represented in GitLab by having issues and MRs that are assigned to responsible persons.

### Meetings

>Mark: **Good**

Feedback: Try to also talk about how your individual meetings are organised. Do you have a chairman/agenda? What do you usually discuss there?
#### Tops:
- Well written information about when other meetings occur.
- Does talk a little about "half-sprint".
#### Tips:
- Should have more information about how the individual meetings take place and how they are organised.

### Decision-Making

>Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback:
#### Tops:
- Good decision-making process.
#### Tips:
- Does not include the scenario when someone really does not agree.

### Dealing with Conflicts

>Mark: **Good**

Feedback:
#### Tops:
- It is good, but I think it involves the TA too soon.
#### Tips:
- You should talk about how to resolve escalations that can't be resolved over a pit of beer without involving the TA.

### Guidance
  
>Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback:
#### Tops:
- Seems reasonable and it was discussed previously.
#### Tips:
- Looks like you answered the question directly instead of writing a paragraph about it.

### Consequences
>Mark: **Good**

Feedback: I want you to think of more scenarios rather than just being late or missing a meeting. What if a team member decides to refactor all the code on their own?
#### Tips:
- Mostly covers just one scenario, can be improved.
#### Tops:
- Does talk about repeated offenses, which is good.

### Success Factors

>Mark: **Very Good**

### Norms or Evaluation Criteria

>Mark: **Good**

Feedback:
- Should have argumentation for each one, so that every member understands why each evaluation criteria is warranted.
