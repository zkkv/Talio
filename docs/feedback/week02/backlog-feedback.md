## Backlog Feedback

### Submission

Mark: **Pass**

Feedback: 

### Backlog Structure

Mark: **Pass** (FAIL)

Feedback: This is a pass for now, because the content and acceptance criteria are very good, and based on my mistake to suggest MOSCOW, however I do ask you to modify it accordingly to the feedback for the deadline in order to pass.
#### Tops:
- Terminology and Stakeholders are clear.
- User stories are good and I like that most of them have acceptance criteria.
#### Tips:
- However, you should not have used MOSCOW, you should have had an Epic list with descriptions and a list of user stories that prioritises those epics.
- A mistake on my part, can be fixed by next week.
- The user stories can also be improved, and you can try to find new ones based on Epics and client QnA.

### Epics

>Mark: **Insufficient**

Feedback: Is in MOSCOW format, so it does not have any mention of epics.
#### Tips:
- Parse from MOSCOW to Epics by final deadline.


### User Stories

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: 
- The format is good on most of them, but some of them do not have the structure "As a user I want... so...", and some of them are straight up confusing, for example: "As an admin I want if the user frees space of the specified item his/her actions are unrestricted". Please recheck every user story and also try to add more based on epics and client QnA.
- Some User stories can be made more atomic, try to figure out which.

### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback:
#### Tops:
- You either have short user stories, or complex ones with acceptance criteria.
- You try to make your acceptance criteria pretty clear.
#### Tips:
- You can add more acceptance criteria about the effect your change has on the object. E.g. After changing color of the tag, the tag is now color x indefinitely.
