	but the order of the other cards is kept in that list
	* when the card is dropped in a new list, it appears first, last or anywhere in-between the other cards, depending on where the cursor is pointing to
	* other users using the board can see the changes happening immediately
after dropping the card
* to reorder the cards inside a list so that I can prioritize tasks
	* reordered cards are visible for everyone

## Convenience 👌😁😎
### As a user I want:
