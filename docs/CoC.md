# Team 66 Code of Conduct
In a Code of Conduct you discuss with each other what you expect from each other and from the collaboration. Everyone participates in this and supports the agreements that you draw up together. A Code of Conduct is a flexible document. If after some time it appears that certain agreements are not realistic or applicable, then it is important to discuss this in the group and adjust the agreements if necessary. Think about what the best way would be to fill out the Code of Conduct with your group.

## Target or ambition level
What grade are you working for?
> We are ambitious and realistic individuals. We are confident in our abilities. For us, the most important thing is to expand our knowledge, but we’ll work as hard as we can for a 10. 


## Products
What should you deliver at the end? On which platform do you share which documents (Discourse/Miro/MS Teams)? What standards must the work submitted meet?
> An application which allows users to create boards with tasks (similar to Trello) should be delivered at the end. User will be able to add lists to boards and join other boards. Each list should have cards with tasks and description. For that we will use JavaFX and Spring Boot. We share documents on Discord in a private channel. Besides that, we will utilize GitLab's functionality to share code and feedback. We will deliver a working application which follows the backlog and the customer requirements along with a good presentation. 


## Planning
How do you ensure that each team member finishes everything on time? Did you clarify who will have a final say in the final deliverable and submits it to Brightspace on behalf of the project group?
> After distributing the tasks, we should have a stand-up meeting a few days before the actual deadline and make sure most of the work is done. If it’s not, we’re going to offer help. We believe that everyone should agree on the final deliverable. Kirill will be responsible for uploading files to Brightspace and he should tell the team if he wants to be replaced. The second responsible person is Diana.

## Behavior
How do you treat each other in the group? How do you handle disagreements within your group? Could your guide or student assistant be involved in reaching consent? What do you do if someone is late during a group meeting?

> We should treat each other with respect and trust. We should resolve issues by a majority of votes and by objective criticism. In case of a tie, we need to choose randomly. The TA can give us tips. If someone is late for 10 minutes or more without a valid reason, they should bring snacks next time for everyone.

> Behaviour that will be punished:
> 1.    Being late to meetings
> 2.    Not answering texts/calls
> 3.    Not meeting deadlines
> 4.    Being disrespectful to teammates
> 5. 	Not complying with the Code of Conduct


## Communication
In what ways do you communicate with each other as a group and among yourselves? Zoom, MS Teams? What information do you share via WhatsApp, e-mail, telephone?
> WhatsApp is the main channel for communication and planning. Screen- and filesharing is done via Discord.

## Commitment
How do you determine the quality of the work your group and each individual team member does?
How do you measure the commitment of the chairs and minute takers?
> Criteria for the quality of work:
> 1. Using Checkstyle for code
> 2. Performing code review of the merge requests
> 3. Give and receive feedback to improve the whole final product

> From the chairs we expect having an agenda before the mandatory meeting and active participation. Minute takers are expected to write down the main points of the meeting.


## Division of tasks and roles 
A decision must be made as to who will be the chairperson and minute taker of your group. How do you determine this? Do the roles change over the course?  
> We determine it by alphabetical order each week so that everyone takes the role at least once. For the last week, either someone who wants to or the person who did best in these roles can take the role again.


## Meetings:
How often will you meet as a group? What preparation is needed for the meetings?
> We’ll have a half-sprint meeting each week to check up with everybody to see who has done what. We can have more meetings if necessary. Everyone needs to be familiar with the previous lectures’ material. The sprint lasts from Tuesday to next Tuesday of each week. For the mandatory Tuesday meeting, the chairperson prepares an agenda but everyone needs to be familiar with it beforehand.


## Decision-making
How do you make decisions? By majority vote or by consensus?
> Preferably, we should have a consensus on every topic. If it doesn't work, we try to make a decision via majority of votes. The last resort is asking TA for help or deciding randomly.


## Dealing with conflicts
How do you handle conflicts within the group?
> We should hear each other out if its related to the task. We should take some time to cool off (maybe discuss it over a pint of beer) and make sure everyone in the group aims to resolve it. Otherwise, ask for help from the TA.

## Guidance
What do you expect from the teacher's and/or student assistant’s guidance? What do you want feedback on, on the content or on the collaboration?
> We expect them to act as mediators and give us advice when needed. We want to hear feedback on both the content and the collaboration.


## Consequences
What are the consequences if a participant in the group does not keep the agreements?
> For the first rule break, we’ll talk about what happened in the first meeting. After this, if there is another misbehavior from the same member, they must bring snacks. If this happens again, they should bring free beer for every member. Finally, the team should talk with the TA to get help. 


## Success factors
What makes your team a dream team?
> We come from different backgrounds and think that exchanging our experience might benefit us greatly. We're all passionate, dedicated, hardworking individuals. We look forward towards the competition with other teams. During the following weeks we'll try to find out everyone's strengths and weaknesses and adjust the workflow accordingly.
